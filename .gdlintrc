# GDLint configuration for GodotGherkin
# See: https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit

# Disabled rules - use the 'disable' list
disable:
  - class-definitions-order  # Too many existing violations to fix at once
  - unused-argument          # Many callbacks require unused args (signal handlers)

# Relax max-public-methods - game objects naturally have many methods
# main_menu.gd (86), settings_manager.gd (70) are API-heavy singletons
max-public-methods: 90

# Relax max-file-lines - some files like main_game.gd, main_system_handlers.gd and lobby.gd
# are intentionally large due to complex UI and state management. These handle Steam
# integration, character selection, network states, and game loop coordination.
max-file-lines: 1600

# Relax max-returns - state machines and decision functions need multiple returns
max-returns: 12

# Relax max-line-length to 160 (more practical for game code)
max-line-length: 160

# Allow _HELP_ prefixed constants for PankuConsole autocomplete documentation
# Pattern: standard SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE or _HELP_xxx constants
constant-name: "(_HELP_[a-z_]+|[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)"

# Keep these enabled - they catch real issues:
# - no-else-return: Improves readability
# - mixed-tabs-and-spaces: Prevents formatting issues
# - duplicated-load: Catches actual bugs
